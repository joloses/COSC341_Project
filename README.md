# COSC341_Project: Team Up

Team Up is an app that allows registered users to put themselves out there in the Sport World! Inspired by apps such as Tinder, we let users present themselves through the sport they play or the physical activities they enjoy. Our users can input numerous preferences such as age, level of play (from casual to professional), their sport, and more! From here, they can chat, form groups/teams, and coordinate events with other users that can yield long-lasting teammates within our usersâ€™ local communities.
