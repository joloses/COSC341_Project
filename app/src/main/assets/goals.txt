AgConnect is here to provide you with technology that can assist you with making friends. To accomplish this task, we have four main goals:
1) To provide you with a means of creating a profile that represents who you are.
2) To connect you with potential friends who have similar goals and interests to you.
3) To provide you with a means to chat with friends once a connection has been established.
4) To advertise local Kelowna events you can attend with new and old friends.
